# Machine Learning Challenge - Exoplanet Exploration

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. To help process this data, a machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset was created. Steps taken to do this were:

- Preprocess the raw data
- Tune the models
- Compare two or more models

The raw data can be seen here - https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results 

Tools used:
- Python
- Python Libraries - Pandas, sklearn, joblib
